Continuity Interruption (CI) is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool.

Give it a list of directories in a configuration.  Each directory should
be a part of the project to test.  Each directory should have a subdirectory
named 'ci' with files 'update', 'prepare', and 'test'.  CI will run these
scripts to prepare you application for test and test it.

The return values from the scripts in the ci directory should be zero unless
and error occurs.

Reporting (success or error) is doine via the 'report' script.
